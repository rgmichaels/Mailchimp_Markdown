Hello there and happy new year!

This is certainly far from ideal, especially since there are
proven gems that accomplish all of this in a few lines.  (redcarpet?)
There are edge cases that would need to be handled.

This was made with Ruby 2.7 (x64) but it's pretty basic and should run on all versions.

It should be able to run via command prompt, however I have been running through Rubymine.
The file to execute is Main.rb.

It takes an input file (SupportingFiles/markdownexample.txt)
and outputs to screen and Output/markdownoutput.txt.

A basic error log is written to Logs/MailchimpMarkdown.log.
